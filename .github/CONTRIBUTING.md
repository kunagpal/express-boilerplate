### How to contribute?

#### Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for express-boilerplate. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report,
reproduce the behavior, and find related reports. Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you
are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. If you'd like, you can use [this template](https://github.com/kunagpal/express-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
to structure the information.

##### Before submitting a bug report
* Check the debugging guide. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the
latest version.

* Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

##### Good bug reports
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue [here](https://github.com/kunagpal/express-boilerplate/issues/new) and provide the following information.

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're
  providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* If the problem is related to performance, include a CPU profile capture and a screenshot with your report.
* Provide more context by answering these questions:
    1. Can you reproduce the problem in safe mode?
    2. Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of express-boilerplate) or was this always a problem?
    3. If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of express-boilerplate? What's the most recent version in which the
      problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of express-boilerplate from the releases page.
    4. Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
    5. If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some? Does the
      problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with
      large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

* Include details about your configuration and environment:
    1. Which version of express-boilerplate are you using?
    2. What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
    3. Are you running express-boilerplate in a virtual machine? If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host
      and the guest?

#### Enhancements
This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for express-boilerplate, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing
functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion, and find related suggestions. Before creating enhancement
suggestions, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many
details as possible. If you'd like, you can use [this template](https://github.com/kunagpal/express-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to structure
the information.

##### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion
* Check the debugging guide for tips â€” you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Also check if you're using the latest version of express-boilerplate.
* Check if there's already a package which provides that enhancement.
* Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

##### Good enhancement suggestions
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue on [here](https://github.com/kunagpal/express-boilerplate/issues/new)

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
* Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most express-boilerplate users.
* List some other boilerplates / generators where this enhancement exists.
* Specify which version of express-boilerplate you're using.
* Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.

#### Pull requests
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Follow the JavaScript style guide described in the ESLint config.
* Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured Mocha tests in the `test` folder. Run them using npm test. See the test style guide below.
* Document new code based on the documentation style guide
* End files with a newline.
* Place requires in the following order:
    1. Built in Node Modules (such as path)
    2. Built in express-boilerplate and express-boilerplate Shell Modules (such as express-boilerplate, shell)
    3. Local Modules (using relative paths)
    4. Keep a blank line between each set of requires.
* Avoid platform-dependent code:
    1. Use path.join() to concatenate filenames.
    2. Use os.tmpdir() rather than /tmp when you need to reference the temporary directory.
    3. Using a plain return when returning explicitly at the end of a function.
* Not return null, return undefined, null, or undefined
* For more details, see the [pull request template](https://github.com/kunagpal/express-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

### Code style guides

#### Git Commit Messages
* Use the past tense ("Added feature" not "Add feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 50 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
* When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit description
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    1. :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    2. :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    3. :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    4. :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
    5. :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
    6. :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
    7. :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
    8. :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    9. :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
    10. :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    11. :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    12. :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
    13. :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    14. :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
    15. :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

#### JavaScript style guide

#### Test style guide

* No two `it` blocks must have the same description.
* No two `describe` blocks must have the same description.
* Tests related to one method or flow must be placed in one `describe` block.

##### Structural tests

* These test look after project structure, and ensure that all configuration settings are in order.
* Any changes to project build / lint configuration should be accompanied by corresponding changes in their tests.
* These tests **do not** add to code test coverage metrics.

##### Unit tests

* All tests in `test/unit` should test one function, and one function only.
* Multiple `it` test blocks can test one function, but under different conditions.
* Unit tests contribute to code test coverage metrics.

###### End to end (E2E / integration) tests

* All tests in `test/e2e` should test a given branch in the functionality chain.
* Since these chains may involve multiple function invocations within them, these tests are kept separate from unit tests.
* These tests **do not** contribute toward code test coverage metrics.

#### Documentation style guide

* Use JSDoc
* Do run `npm run docs` locally to ensure that documentation generation is indeed valid.

### Additional notes

#### Labels
This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Some are specific to express-boilerplate. GitHub search makes it easy to use
labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in open issues across express-boilerplate and all
express-boilerplate-owned packages which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced or perhaps open pull requests in express-boilerplate which haven't
been reviewed yet. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in express-boilerplate only and
also across all express-boilerplate repositories. We encourage you to read about other search filters which will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from
the same group. Please open an issue express-boilerplate if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please
open an issue on that repository.
